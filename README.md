<p>Episode HC</p>

<p>THE HOMECOMING AWAKENS</p>

<br>

<p>The galaxy is buzzing with excitement...</p>

<p>Rumors speak of an epic night filled with music, questionable dance moves, and maybe... lightsabers.</p>

<p>But no Jedi should go alone.</p>

<p>One brave padawan â€” Noah â€” must now face a destiny of great importance...</p>

<p>A friend has sent this message across the galaxy.</p>

<br>

<p>Noah, will you be their co-pilot for Homecoming?</p>

<p>Theyâ€™ve chosen *you*. Yes, you.</p>

<br>

<p>This isn't a trap. (Definitely not set by the Empire.)</p>

<p>Just one friend asking another... to join the Rebellion (and dance).</p>

<button onclick="playSaber(); alert('You had no choice anyway â€” itâ€™s your destiny ðŸ’«')">Absolutely Yes</button>
